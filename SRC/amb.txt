AMB FORMAT SPECIFICATION

  last updated: 2020-12-16

  The latest version of this file can be found on the AMB project's homepage:
~http://amb.osdn.io~

  An AMB file (~Ancient Machine Book~) is an extremely lightweight file format
meant to store any kind of hypertext documentation that may be comfortably
viewed even on the most ancient PCs: technical manuals, books, etc. Think of
it as a retro equivalent of a *.CHM help file. The AMB format is designed to
allow for some limited formatting, support internal links and require very
little processing power to read, so a reader may be run even on the oldest
IBM PC. The format also strives for simplicity of implementation.

THE AMB CONTAINER

  The AMB file is a container - one could say it is a very simplistic archive
format. It starts with a 4-bytes format signature (magic value) "~AMB1~". Then
comes a 2-bytes number that tells how many files are present in the container,
followed by the list of all files: each file is described by a file entry.
All values are little-endian.

  The AMB archive is expected to contain a set of AMA (Ancient Machine
Article) files, and optionally a title file, an index dictionary and a
codepage map.

  An AMB archive must contain at least one AMA file named ~index.ama~ - this is
the first file that an AMB reader will try loading.

~NOTE~: Names of files contained in an AMB archive are to be processed in a case
      insensitive way and must be composed exclusively of 7-bit characters.

!doc amb_title
DOCUMENT TITLE

  The AMB title is a string that may be displayed as the document's main title.
To set such title, the AMB archive has to contain a file named simply 'title'
that would contain the text. The title string should not be longer than
64 characters, anything longer might be truncated by the reader.

  The title of the document is expected to be encoded with the same codepage as
all the articles. See codepage encoding.

!doc amb_format
AMA FORMAT

  The AMA format is a text-based file format. For guaranteed interoperability
with old machines, its maximum allowed size is 65535 bytes (ie. 2^16 - 1).
Larger contents must be segmented into a set of two or more AMA articles.

  An AMB reader must display content with a 78-characters width, hence an AMA
article must not contain any line longer than 78 displayable characters. Lines
longer than this limit may be truncated by the client reader.

  AMA articles may contain control codes. A control code is a characters pair,
where the first is a percent (~%~) character. Possible control codes:

  ~%t~   normal text follows (default state)
  ~%h~   heading follows
  ~%l~   link follows (filename ended by a ':', followed by a description)
  ~%!~   notice/warning follows
  ~%b~   boring text follows (usually displayed grey on grey)
  ~%%~   display a percent character (%)

  It is important to note that the current text mode is reset to ~%t~ at the end
of every line, hence there is no need to prefix a line of text with ~%t~.

  Line endings may be either ~LF~ or ~CR/LF~. The former is recommended, as it is
more compact.

~TAB~ control codes (ASCII decimal value 9) are ~NOT allowed~ in AMA files.

  Whenever an external URL appears in an AMA file (for example a link to a web
page, to a ftp resource or to a gopher hole) it is encouraged to be enclosed
between ~<>~ characters.

  Example: ~<http://amb.osdn.io>~

  This is only a typesetting recommendation based on RFC 3986, it is not
part of the AMA specification. Following it would, however, make it much
easier for modern AMB readers to detect such links automatically and make
them clickable.

!doc amb_codepage_enc
CODEPAGE ENCODING

  Since ancient computers are displaying text as 8-bit characters due to the
design of early video adapters, AMA files are expected to contain 8-bit text
as well. The exact codepage is unspecified by this format definition and
depends on the document's target audience.

  To ease displaying of AMB books on modern (unicode-enabled) platforms, any
AMB file that contains non-7-bit characters ~SHOULD~ also contain a file named
~unicode.map~. This file contains a sequence of 128 16-bit values, mapping
bytes of the range 128..255 into unicode datapoint values. Such file can be
readily output by the ~utf8tocp~ program ~http://utf8tocp.sourceforge.net~.

!doc amb_index_data
INDEX DATA

  On top of AMA files, the AMB archive may contain a file named DICT.IDX. This
file, if it exists, provides indexing metadata to allow the client to perform
fast and efficient full-text searches across the AMB book.

  The index file contains a hash table: a serie of 256 16-bit indexes, where
each index points to a region of the index structure that contains a list of
words (LoW). The index (0..255) itself is an 8 bits hash based on the length
of the word and its characters. The checksum is made of two nibbles: LC.
The high nibble (L) is the length of the word minus 2, while the low nibble
(C) is a simple checksum of all the word's characters XORed together. This
algorithm can be formalized as follows:

  ~((wordlen - 2) << 4) | ((a & 15) XOR (b & 15) XOR (...))~

  For example, the word "Disk" would end up being indexed under value 0x25,
because:

     ((4 - 2) << 4) | ((D & 15) XOR (i & 15) XOR (s & 15) XOR (k & 15))

translates to:  (2 << 4) | (4 XOR 9 XOR 3 XOR 11)
which leads to:       32 | 5
resulting in:         37 = 0x25

  After the index we can find the pointer to the words list. A pointer is a 16
bits file offset from the index structure start.

  It needs to be noted that words of less than 2 characters and more than 17
characters cannot be indexed. The presented algorithm has also the interesting
side-effect of indexing low and high caps of the ranges a..z and A..Z
identically. An important limitation is the fact that the list of words (LoW)
is restricted by the 16-bit addressing offset, which means that all LoWs must
start at an offset within the first 64 KiB of the file.

  Now that we know the offset at which our LoW starts, we can read the words.
First go to the offset, and read a single 16 bits word. Its value contains the
number of words in the list. Then, read the words one after another (note that
all words in the list have the same length, and you know this length already).
Words are always written in lower case characters. Each word is followed by a
1-byte value that tells how many files the word has been found in. Then, that
many 32-bit file identifiers follow.

index format:

 ~* List of words~

    xx   number of words in the list
    ?    word
    x    how many files the word is present in
    xxxx file identifier 1
    xxxx file identifier 2
    ...
    xxxx file identifier n

    (other 255 lists of words follow)

 ~* hash table~

    xx offset of the LoW for words that match hash 0x00
    xx offset of the LoW for words that match hash 0x01
    ...
    xx offset of the LoW for words that match hash 0xff

!doc amb_rationale
RATIONALE

  The AMB format is, by design, burdened by several limitations. These
limitations might be misunderstood as shortcomings, while in essence the AMB
format's primary objective is to stay as primitive as possible - so it is easy
(and fast) for software to parse and display. Below are listed some of these
limitations, with explanations about the reasons that led to them.

 ~* Line length limited to 78 characters~

  The hard-coded limit of 78 chars is meant to ensure that the reader will
not have to worry about line wrapping, which highly simplifies the reader's
code thus allowing for faster processing and minimizing potential bugs. It
is also meant to allow the content creator to design his screens in a
deterministic way - that is, without any risk that his semigraphic tables,
ASCII drawings or overall screen disposition will be broken by a reader that
attempts to rewrap the text at an unpredictable width. The 80-columns width
was ubiquitous since the early 80' and seems to be a reasonable baseline
expectation, and a 78-characters limit allows the reader to use two columns
for its own needs (vertical cursor, border, etc).

 ~* No control over style (colors) applied to text~

  The AMB format defines a set of semantic tags (like "%h" for "heading"). It
does not allow control over the exact colors or attributes that will be used
by the output device to render the document. This is designed on purpose: AMB
documents should be displayable also on monochrome devices. There may also be
devices that allow for text attributes like "underlined", "bold", etc - it is
up to the AMB reader to make sure the semantic tags are translated into
colors/shades/attributes combinations that are nicely rendered on the target
hardware.

 ~* Article size limit of 64 KiB~

  A single article (AMA file) is limited to a maximum length of 64 KiB (minus
one byte). This limitation makes it easier for MS-DOS readers to load the
content: in real-mode Intel memory models, a single memory segment is
addressable via 16-bit offsets, hence processing content larger than 64 KiB
becomes tricky, as it involves crossing memory segment boundaries, or
relying on some kludges like "huge" memory pointers (slow), or dynamically
reloading parts of the file from disk (very slow). 64 KiB still allows for
more than 30 pages of 80x25 packed text, which should be more than enough
even for very complex subjects (and larger contents should simply be
dispatched into two or more different articles, which can only be
beneficial for readability).

 ~* Maximum number of 65535 articles~

  An AMB book may contain up to 65535 articles and not a single more, because
the number of articles is written as a 16-bit integer in the file's header.
This allows AMB software to use 16-bit integers when addressing the articles,
which is very convenient (and fast) for platforms with 16-bit CPUs. And
honestly - is that really a limitation? Even the entire Bible has "only" 1189
chapters, or 31103 verses.

 ~* Short filenames + low-ascii characters only~

  Filenames inside an AMB container are limited to 12 (8+3) characters so
an AMB container can be unpacked on an old MS-DOS system. The filenames must
contain only low-ascii (7-bit) characters -- for two reasons: so it is
possible to unpack an AMB container on any filesystem, independently of
the codepage said filesystem relies on, and to make it possible to reliably
perform case-insensitive matching of filenames.
