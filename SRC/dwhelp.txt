!link dwh_rle_unpack RLE decompression for strings

!doc dwhelp_writers_guide
Writers guide

  DWHELP use plain text file with a small markup:

1. Document markup
2. Text formatting markup

  Unicode is not supported :(

---

~1. Document markup~

  Document markup allow organize hypertext ability for your document. Here is
only two tags: ~!doc~ and ~!link~ - this is everythign what you must known
about it :)

  ~NOTE:~ Each tag must be placed into begin of new line without spaces.

  ~!doc~ - used to mark start new document and must contain "document id".

Example: !doc copyright_notice

  So, in a future, you can use string "copyright_notice" in link
to this document.
  
  ~!link~ - used to add link to another document

Example: !link copyright_notice My copyright text

  In this example, user will see text "My copyright text" as link.

---

~2. Text formatting markup~

   Here is no rich markup definitions, only two:

1. You can use ~---~ (minus, 3 times) as markup for horizontal line.

2. "Wave-form minus" (i can't show it due to lack of escape sequence -
ASCII 0x7E or 126 in decimal). This wave-minus mark highlighted text begin
and end.

   All others - you can format your text as a plain document, including
ASCII art.

---

~3. Full example~

   ~!doc my_document~
   Root document
   Some text. Some text.
   ---
   Some text.
   !link doc2 See another document
   Some text.

   ~!doc doc2~
   Second document
   Some text.

~Example explanation:~

   This help contains two document (with ids: ~my_document~, ~doc2~),
First document (title: "Root document") contains link to second
(title: "Second document"). Link is visible as text "See another document".

RLE decompression for strings in DWHELP

  Here is reference implementation:

~FUNCTION dwh_rle_unpack(VAR s : STRING) : STRING;~
VAR
        r      : STRING;
        i, len : INTEGER;
        c      : CHAR;
BEGIN
        r[0] := '';
        i := 1;
        len := Length(s);
        WHILE i <= len DO BEGIN
                c := s[i];
                IF ORD(c) IN [3..15] THEN BEGIN
                        FillChar(r[ORD(r[0]) + 1], ORD(c), s[i + 1]);
                        INC(r[0], ORD(c));
                        INC(i, 2);
                END ELSE BEGIN
                        INC(r[0]);
                        r[ORD(r[0])] := c;
                        INC(i);
